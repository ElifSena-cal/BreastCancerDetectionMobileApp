# Breast Cancer Detection Mobile Application

This mobile application is part of a project focused on diagnosing breast cancer using an artificial intelligence model. The application provides users with the ability to input data related to cellular features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass, and get a prediction regarding the likelihood of breast cancer.

## Repository

This mobile application is a part of a larger project. For more information about the complete project, including the desktop application and API, please refer to the [main repository]([https://github.com/ElifSena-cal/BreastCancer](https://github.com/ElifSena-cal/BreastCancerDiagnosis).

## Features

- **Input Data:** Users can input cellular features computed from a digitized image of an FNA.
- **Prediction:** The application uses a trained machine learning model to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on the input data.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application provides an easy-to-use interface for inputting data and receiving predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** The application is developed using the Flutter framework for cross-platform mobile development.
- **API Integration:** The application communicates with a Flask API for model prediction.
- **Model Usage:** The application uses the most recently trained model for making predictions.
